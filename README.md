# Web Workshop 🚧

Craft handmade websites in their natural habitat (your web browser).

Web Workshop was born as a teaching tool for web development classes, with the goal of making web publishing more accessible, especially to those who have never written code before.

By stripping away complexity and focusing on the basics, Web Workshop turns website building into something playful and toylike; a creative playground where you can experiment, break things, and watch your ideas materialize in real-time.

Recently, Web Workshop has become an editor of choice for <a href="https://html.energy/html-day/2025/index.html">HTML Day</a>, an annual celebration of handmade websites and the creative web.
